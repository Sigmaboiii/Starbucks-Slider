# Starbucks-slider:

- What is going on guys its your boi sigma and today I have came with a very good project.
- This project is based on a starbucks slider and it basically is a landing page with slider of coffee flavours

# Things to have:

- Node.js (You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer).
Yeah thats it

# How to run the code:

- Before running the code, check if you have node.js by running the following the command:
-     node -v
- After checking that you have Node.js, go to this project's directory and run the following command:
-     npm install
- Then, after the dependencies are installed, run the following command:
-     node server.js
- This will run the the code on port 3000 (You can change the port from the server.js.)
Enjoy!
